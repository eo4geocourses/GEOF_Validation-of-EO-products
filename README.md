This is a lesson on Validation of EO products. Errors in satellite, aero and drone data products are known unknowns. However, quantifying the quality of these products by decomposing the inherent uncertainty components is a very challenging task. Validation refers to the process of assessing the uncertainty of higher level, satellite sensor derived products by analytical comparison to reference data, which is presumed to represent the true value of an attribute. This course provides an overview of EO data validation procedures and frameworks.

-	Understand the basic terms in EO data validation.
-	Understand and distinguish terms ‘’error’’ and ‘’uncertainty’’ of EO data.
-	Understand EO data validation processes.
